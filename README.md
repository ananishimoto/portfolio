# Portfolio static website

This is a project made with Vue + Nuxt to have a grasp on the framework, but as for now, this is the HTML and styling setup for the page.

Thinking in scalability and easy refactoring for further functionalities, Nuxt has been implemented since the beginning, making it easier to add logic and communication between the front and backend.

The deployed version is on Vercel, and can be accessed on this link: https://portfolio-black-eight-65.vercel.app/
