# Portfolio static website

This is a project made with Vue + Nuxt to have a grasp in the framewrok, but as for now, this is the HTML and styling setup for the page.

Thinking in scalability and easy refactoring for further functionalities, Nuxt is implemented since the beginning, making it easier to add logic and communication between front and backend.
